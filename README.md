Email Spam Classifier
This project is a beginner-friendly Python machine learning application that classifies email messages as spam or not spam (“ham”). It uses a public spam email dataset and applies natural language processing (NLP) with text cleaning and vectorization, along with a logistic regression model built using scikit-learn.

Summary
This project develops a simple machine learning model to classify emails as spam or not spam, using Python and scikit-learn. It demonstrates core ML techniques for text classification and emphasizes hands-on collaboration and GitHub-based workflow.​
